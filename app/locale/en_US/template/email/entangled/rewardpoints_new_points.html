            <p>
                Your receipt for your recent purchase is being sent shortly. Meanwhile,
                here is your NEW Entangled Fanatic Rewards Point balance: {{var points_balance}}.
            </p>
            <p>
                Go to <strong style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="{{store url='customer/account/login'}}">My Account</a></strong> in the
                black bar of every page to view your points balance, review your recent purchases, and update any information you need.
                You can print a receipt there, too.
            </p>
